`3DView <http://3dview.irap.omp.eu/>`__ is one of the main data providers handled by speasy. All products are either available using directly the 3DView module or using :meth:`speasy.get_data()`.
:meth:`speasy.get_data()` usage should be preferred over 3DView module methods since it is more flexible and it's interface is guaranteed to be more stable.
The following documentation will focus on 3DView module specific usage.
