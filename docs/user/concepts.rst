Speasy concepts

The inventory
-------------

Every provider builds a searchable **inventory** of the products it offers, exposed two ways:

- ``spz.inventories.tree.<provider>`` (or ``spz.inventories.data_tree.<provider>``) — a nested tree of
  :class:`~speasy.core.inventory.indexes.SpeasyIndex` objects you can browse with tab-completion in
  IPython/Jupyter (e.g. ``spz.inventories.tree.amda.Parameters.ACE.MFI``).
- ``spz.inventories.flat_inventories.<provider>`` — the same products as a flat, dict-like mapping keyed
  by product id, handy for programmatic lookup (``"ace" in spz.inventories.flat_inventories.ssc.parameters``).

Leaf index objects (e.g. a :class:`~speasy.core.inventory.indexes.ParameterIndex`) can be passed directly
to :func:`speasy.get_data` instead of a string id. They expose their identity through accessors
(``idx.spz_uid()``, ``idx.spz_name()``, ``idx.spz_provider()``) and the provider's own metadata as plain
attributes (``start_date``, ``description``, ...). Inventories are refreshed when Speasy is imported and
cached locally; ``inventories.cache_retention_days`` (see :doc:`configuration`) sets how long a cached
copy is considered fresh.

Product types
-------------

Most calls to :func:`speasy.get_data` return a :class:`~speasy.products.variable.SpeasyVariable`, a
single time series (see :doc:`plotting`, :doc:`numpy` and :doc:`scipy` for what you can do with one). A few other product
types exist for specific use cases:

- :class:`~speasy.products.catalog.Event` — a time interval (like a ``DateTimeRange``) with attached metadata.
- :class:`~speasy.products.catalog.Catalog` — an ordered collection of ``Event`` objects, e.g. all the
  intervals where a particular phenomenon was detected.
- :class:`~speasy.products.timetable.TimeTable` — an ordered collection of plain time intervals, commonly
  used to drive a batch fetch (pass a ``TimeTable`` as ``get_data()``'s time range to retrieve one
  variable for every interval at once).
- :class:`~speasy.products.dataset.Dataset` — a collection of ``SpeasyVariable`` objects for every
  parameter of an instrument/dataset, indexable by variable name (``dataset['b_gse']``).

Today, Catalogs, TimeTables, and Datasets are produced by the :doc:`AMDA module <amda/amda>`; see its
:ref:`amda_catalogs_timetables` and :ref:`amda_datasets` sections for a walkthrough, including
:ref:`using a TimeTable to batch-fetch and analyze data <amda_timetable_batch_fetch>`.

.. _time_ranges:

Time ranges
-----------

``get_data()`` and similar calls accept ``start``/``stop`` as plain strings (e.g. ``"2016-6-2"`` or
``"2018-01-01T01:00:00"``), :class:`~datetime.datetime` objects, or :class:`numpy.datetime64` values.
String times are parsed as **UTC**; Speasy does not apply any local timezone conversion. Any precision
from whole days down to sub-second (e.g. ``"2018-01-01T01:00:00.123456"``) is accepted.

.. _coordinate_systems:

Coordinate systems
------------------

Trajectories and vector quantities only mean something together with the coordinate frame they are
expressed in, and each provider offers its own set of frames. Some let you pick one per request
(SSCWeb's ``coordinate_system``, CDPP 3DView's ``coordinate_frame``), some make it a level of the
inventory tree (UiowaEphTool), and some bake it into the product itself (the CDAWeb and CSA products
named ``..._gse``, ``B_RTN``, and so on).

See each provider's page for the frames it supports and how to select one. Picking the wrong frame
returns believable-looking but physically wrong vectors, so it is worth checking which frame you
actually got before comparing data across missions.

Units
-----

Speasy does not convert units: values and the ``UNITS`` metadata field are passed through exactly as
provided by the source service (AMDA, CDAWeb, ...). Check a variable's ``.unit`` attribute or its
``UNITS``/``CATDESC`` metadata to know what you're actually looking at.

Errors and empty results
------------------------

A **known** product (one Speasy's inventory recognizes) with no data in the requested time range makes
``get_data()`` (and ``get_dataset()``/``get_catalog()``/``get_timetable()``) return ``None`` rather than
raise. Always check for ``None`` before using the result:

.. code-block:: python

    import speasy as spz
    var = spz.get_data("amda/imf", "1900-01-01", "1900-01-02")  # valid product, no data that far back
    if var is None:
        print("No data returned — check the product id and time range")
    else:
        var.plot()

An **unrecognized** product id or inventory path, on the other hand, raises ``ValueError`` immediately
(Speasy can't even identify which provider/product to ask), and some providers raise a provider-specific
exception for certain invalid arguments (e.g. CDPP 3DView raises ``Cdpp3dViewWebException`` for an invalid
``coordinate_frame``):

    >>> import speasy as spz
    >>> spz.get_data("amda/this_product_does_not_exist", "2018-01-01", "2018-01-02")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: Unknown product: this_product_does_not_exist

Network failures raise as well, so a robust caller wants a ``try``/``except`` around the call and a
``None`` check on the result.
